Daily Scrum - Sprint 3 Day 5
Date: November 5, 2024
Team: Adam Pflantzer

Adam: Good morning. Let me give you my update for today.

Yesterday:
I completed STORY-007, the High-Fidelity Mockups for All Workspaces. It's fully done, client reviewed and approved. All three workspaces - Employee Center, IT Services, and HR - now have complete high-fidelity designs ready for development.

I made good progress on STORY-008, the Employee Center Homepage Development. I'd say it's about 70% complete. The main layout and navigation are done, I've built out the quick actions section, but I still need to wire up the personalization features and the notifications widget.

Today:
I'm going to finish STORY-008 this morning - should be done by lunch. After that, I'm starting on STORY-015, the Mobile Responsiveness Testing and Optimization. That one should be straightforward since I've been building mobile-first from the start.

Blockers:
I'm blocked on STORY-012, the SSO Integration Implementation. We've been waiting for the client's IT team to provide the SSO configuration details for 3 days now. This is becoming critical because STORY-018 and STORY-021 both depend on SSO being set up for proper testing. Without it, users won't be able to authenticate properly, and we can't test the full login flow with real users.

I think we need to schedule an urgent meeting with the client's IT team this week to get those SSO details. Otherwise, we're looking at a 2-3 day delay on the sprint, and those stories might slip to the next sprint.

Other notes:
The client mentioned in an email yesterday that they'd like to add mobile push notifications for ticket updates. That wasn't in the original scope, so I wanted to flag it for discussion. It's probably an 8-point story, maybe more if we need to build out the notification infrastructure. I don't think we should add it to this sprint - we're already at capacity.

That's it for today. Any questions?
